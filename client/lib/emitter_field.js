// emitter_field — the `particles` component's LIFECYCLE, DOM-free and
// THREE-free so it can be unit-tested without a browser (tools/emitters-test.ts).
//
// The upstream builder (`eidoverse/particles.js`) is a one-way door: it makes a
// mesh, adds it to a scene, pushes its billboard `update` into the global
// `_autoParticleSystems` array, and hands back no way to undo any of that.
// Flora taught the same lesson and got `dispose()` upstream; until particles
// does, THIS is where the undo lives — one registry that owns every emitter in
// the world, so "replace the fire with smoke" retires the fire instead of
// stacking a second system and a second per-frame hook on top of it.
//
// Everything here is idempotent by construction: applying the same state twice
// is a no-op, removing something that is already gone is a no-op, and a build
// that finishes AFTER its own entity was replaced or removed retires itself on
// arrival rather than leaking into the scene.
