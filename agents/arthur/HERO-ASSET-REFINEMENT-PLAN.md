# HERO-ASSET REFINEMENT PLAN — commons-next carousel

Lane: `polish-N`. Entity: `nx-carousel` (polish-only per INTERLANE-PROTOCOL).
Canonical loop: `agents/arthur/HERO-ASSET-REFINEMENT-LOOP.md`.

## Baseline at campaign start (polish-258)

- Live tuple: `nx-carousel` @ pos `[-18, 0.00014950061063032772, 18]`, yaw `2.35619`, scale 1.
- Baseline hash (nvp-6 optimized build): `d41a898f3054874b9918b1adf4f0fe3674088baa86416cf5a6c8ec84bd8958ec` (43 nodes / 37 draws).
- Comp bag (7 keys, preserve through every re-place): spin `carousel`, bobs `horse_0/2/4/6`, `sockets`, `particles:smoke` (origin `[0,6.3,0]`).
- Evidence: `agents/arthur/reviews/hero-assets/polish-258-carousel/before/`.

## Ranked criteria (from loop file; judge from current pixels)

1. gameplay silhouette / carousel identity
2. crown/canopy hierarchy (apex, pitch, eave rhythm, underside)
3. horse quality (anatomy, poses, pole/suspension, trapping)
4. platform/fascia/ticket-entry storytelling
5. value/material hierarchy (festive cream/red/gold/wood, no noise)
6. night identity (warm glow, beacon crown)
7. motion pair, rider sockets, grounding

## Iteration history

### polish-258 — gold spire + scalloped valance (ACCEPTED, LIVE)

- Defect: apex was a nearly-dead 0.18r brass bead (cone apex 5.99, bead 6.08) and
  the eave a straight dark brass band — silhouette read gazebo, not carousel.
- Change (single coherent crown intervention, `mkcarousel.ts`): brass collar +
  tapered gold spire to y 6.68; 16 alternating gold/fabric point-down scallop
  teeth at r 3.08 under the eave. All merged statics; no new KEEP names.
- Candidate hash: `46b21e1ed494f89da168c4011ddd14077c745ccf50fa007b13290feb145c894f`
  (45 nodes / 38 draws — inside 5–45 band). Two consecutive rebuilds byte-identical.
- Falsification verdict: clearly better — spire crowns the apex, valance reads
  as festive rhythm, gameplay silhouette now carousel; night beacon read holds;
  lanterns unobstructed; no floating teeth / z-fighting.
- Placed via `next-place-carousel.ts` (hash-gated, comp re-applied): live lib
  `store/46b21e1ed494f89d.glb`, tuple exact, 7 comp keys verified, idempotent
  rerun = zero verbs.
- Note: `verify-repairs.ts` pins `av-carousel` in world `commons` (read-only
  reference) — left at polish-256 pin 38fbbc26dcdfcc1a by design.
- Evidence: `agents/arthur/reviews/hero-assets/polish-258-carousel/after/`.

## Next highest-value defects (re-judge from current pixels each tick)

- Crown underside at close range: rib/valance junction density unjudged.
- Horse trappings: saddle/blanket readability at 10–18m unjudged this tick.
- Ticket-entry/fascia storytelling unjudged.

## Post-carousel queue

Ranked by gameplay visibility when carousel is internally hero-ready:
plaza hearth, belltower, welcome ensemble, tower. Present Bill one concise
eye-gate packet exactly once at that point.
