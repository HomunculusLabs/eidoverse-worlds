// Pose provenance — the agent-side half of #61.
//
// The server's settledPose (tools/settled-pose-test.ts) strips ragdoll frames
// at every hand-off — but it keys on the CLIP LABEL, and the field showed a
// tumble frame that had been relabelled "idle" agent-side before it ever
// reached a sanitizer: princess's settled ragdoll bag rode `heldPose` under
// clip "idle" for weeks, got remembered by the server as an "enacted pose",
// re-armed on every restore, and survived every explicit `posture stand`
// (which only changed the label). These tests pin the invariant that closes
// that loop: a physics pose may only ever leave the process labelled
// "ragdoll", and any decision to move sheds the held pose entirely.
//
// Deliberately no sockets, no sim, no VRM: WorldAgent is constructed cold and
// driven through its public methods; wire-level behavior is asserted against
// the SOURCE (the settled-pose-test pattern), so reverting a call site fails
// the suite.
